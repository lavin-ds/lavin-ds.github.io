      <h1>Underlying Lies</h1>
      <p><img src="underlying-lies.png" alt="lies"></p>
<p>We were two travelers in the river of life,
it was the same destination but
different boats.</p>
<p>We were both the same,
but then we were different,
Was he like me or I like him</p>
<p>He saved me in pain
when I was low he came
but I left him when I was gay
enjoying the inherent life
forgetting that I had a saviour like him.</p>
<p>We were together
but were miles apart,
he had seen pain and suffering
and had shielded me from it.</p>
<p>But it was I, not us,
him or me; one at a time
And we were away from home
to face life.</p>
<p>But he asked to me to be wary of people
they cheat and make you bleed.
I took no heed
and in the end I did bleed</p>
<p>He ever the friend sat and thoughts I shared
and he showed there was someone who cared!</p>
<p>It was him not me,
or was it I not us.
if the world were to know we were one
they would think us mad but i cared not!</p>
<p>He was the mask that took over,
he was the one who faced the world i had courage not to!
we are the underlying lie,
he was the face inside my head,
screaming to tackle the world all the time,
but I had him in chains!</p>
<p>But there are times when I am not in control,
when emotions flood me,
he breaks free,
and wreaks havoc on the world!</p>
<p>I love her but he hates her,
She takes me to a new level,
he drags be back,
he feels I give too much love to her,
if only I could share the same with him.</p>
<p>But i know not why,
I am unable to find him in happiness,
but now that I come to think I cannot find him these days,
he stays away,
considers me foolish maybe.</p>
<p>If only he could know what pain I have now,
she has left me,
I want to cry,
but am i being selfish?
looking for him again in pain?</p>
<p>Here he comes and shouts at me from afar,
did I not tell you how women are?
Lets us go and spend the rest of our days in peace,
reminiscing the days lost,</p>
<p>It is now only him and me,
in our old age,
walking with help,
all glory lost,
all glamour gone!</p>
<p>He talks to me and I talk to him,
but I still remember her touch,
At night I remember her face,
the love that we had!</p>
<p>He destroyed me thats what he did,
not letting me love,
not letting me play,
the mask of a devil was he.</p>
<p>Oh he is coming now,
I must leave,
he may find my things and then make me read,
And in these last days if he deserts me,
I know not if I shall be able to make the final journey alone!</p>
